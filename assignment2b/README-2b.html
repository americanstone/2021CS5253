  <h3>Image Crawler Parallel Stream App (Assignment 2b)</h3>

  <p>The purpose of this assignment is to deepen your experience using
    Java's functional programming features and their integration with
    Java's parallel streams.  In particular, in this assignment you'll
    develop an app that uses several Java parallel streams strategies
    to obtain, transform, and store images.</p>

  <p> The code you'll write for this assignment has a GUI and runs as
    an Android app. Please feel free to use this app to help debug your
    solution. </p>

  <p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
    assignment: </p>

  <ul>

  <li>Detailed overviews of the Java parallel streams framework are
    available in my YouTube playlist <A
    HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp5ZOxpx_RVkkktBMd0S5B6Q">here</A>.
    Naturally, we cover this material in class.  <p>

  <li>Good overviews of Java sequential and parallel streams appear
  <A
  HREF="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/ma14-java-se-8-streams-2177646.html">here</A>
  and <A
  HREF="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/architect-streams-pt2-2227132.html">here</A>.
  I highly recommend you get the book <A
  HREF="https://www.manning.com/books/modern-java-in-action">Modern
  Java in Action</A> to learn more about Java streams
  programming. </li> </ul>

<h4>Getting Started</h4>

  <p> Before you complete the initial submission of Assignment 2b
    you'll need to do the following: </p>

  <ul>

    <li> Complete your implementation of <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS5253/tree/master/assignment2a/">assignment
    2a</a>, taking into account my review comments.  In particular,
    it's important that your assignment 2a implementation of Java
    sequential streams and associated classes works properly since
    they are used as the basis for the Java parallel stream
    implementation in this assignment.  Please come to office hours or
    post questions on Piazza if you have any remaining questions about
    your assignment 2a solution. </li>

  </ul>

<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The ImageCrawler app is packaged as a project using the latest
version of Android Studio.  This app is written in both Kotlin and
Java and demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the
purposes of Assignment 2b, however, you only need to be aware of the
following directories:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/">image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils</A>
and <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/">image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers</A>,
which contains the skeletons you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test">image-crawler/src/test</A>, which is a
set of unit tests that exercise the features you're implementing and
are used to evaluate whether you've correctly satisfied this
assignment's requirements.  </LI>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="app/src/androidTest/java/assignmentTests">app/src/androidTest/java/assignmentTests</A>,
which is an Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your app
automatically. </li>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The
application's minimum API is 29, so you will need to select an
emulator that uses an API >= 29. If you do not already have one
created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD Manager" button in
the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<H4>Program Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO" tags)!!!
In particular, you'll need to finish implementing the following "TODO"
tasks for this assignment in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/">imagecrawler</A>
folder:

<UL>

<LI> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/ParallelStreamsCrawler.java">crawlers/ParallelStreamsCrawler.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to obtain,
transform, and store images.  This class uses Java parallel streams to
perform an "image crawl" starting from a root Uri.  It applies a
couple of minuscule tweaks to the <A
HREF=image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/SequentialStreamsCrawler.java">SequentialStreamsCrawler.java</A>
class to use Java parallel streams.  Depending on the parameters used
to run the tests, images from HTML pages reachable from the root Uri
are either downloaded from a remote web server or read from the local
file system and the results are stored in the local file system on the
Android device. </LI> <P>

<LI> <A
    HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/SynchronizedArray.java">utils/SynchronizedArray.java</A>.
    You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in this class's methods
    to provide a synchronized implementation of the <CODE>Array</CODE>
    interface that uses Java built-in synchronized statements to
    ensure thread-safe access to the state managed by this class. </LI> <P>

<LI> <A
    HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/ArrayCollector.java">utils/ArrayCollector.java</A>.
    You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to
    complete the concurrent collector implementation in this
    file. This implementation should use the
    <CODE>SynchronizedArray</CODE> to provide a thread-safe mutable
    result container. </LI>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"><A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/Student.kt">utils/Student.kt</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" to set the <CODE>type</CODE> field
to include just <CODE>Graduate</CODE> or <CODE>Undergraduate</CODE>,
depending on which version of the assignment that you're
implementing.</LI>

</UL>

  <p> Your solution should use <EM>no</EM> loops or (unnecessary)
    conditional statements in this assignment and instead use Java
    parallel stream operations and functional programming features.
    </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS5253/tree/master/assignment2b">here</a>
    in my GitHub repository.  Now that you've setup your <a
    href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull
    this skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and
    complete the "TODO" markers.  </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

  <p> The unit tests in the <A
  HREF="image-crawler/src/test/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler">image-crawler/src/test</A>
  folder are provided to increase our confidence that your
  implementation is working as expected.  You'll need to learn how to
  use the Android Studio GUI to run the unit tests locally on your
  computer, as described <A
  HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>.
  As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their
  absence, so don't rely solely on the unit tests to detect problems
  in your code. </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

    <p> Assignment 2b is designed to deepen your experience developing
    apps using Java functional programming features and Java parallel
    streams without the need to program the Java fork-join thread pool
    directly.  The skeletons and unit tests are extensive, though you
    don't need to understand them all to complete your solution.
    Please start early and ask questions in class, office hours, and
    on the Piazza discussion forum. </p>
